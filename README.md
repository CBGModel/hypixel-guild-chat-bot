# ‚ùå Deprecation Notice!

**Please note that this application will not receive any more feature updates.** This is in favour of the newer version, [Hychat](https://github.com/hychat-mc/hychat). As it is being re-written in TypeScript, new bugs may be found and will be retroactively applied to this version. If you find any bugs, report them in [this repositories' issues section](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot/issues). If you would like to request new features, please do so in the [new version's issues section](https://github.com/hychat-mc/hychat/issues), as I will likely add it. At this stage, new PRs will still be reviewed. **Once the new version is fully released, this application will no longer be maintained, and no new changes will be accepted.**

The new version of this application will feature a dashboard, easier customization, and allow bot management through a Discord bot. It will become SaaS (Software as a Service) for those people who do not wish to create their own personal server. **If you are just finding this repository now, please consider waiting for the new version to release, as it will be much more stable and feature-complete.** Updates will be provided on the [website](https://hych.at) and via the [Hychat Twitter](https://twitter.com/hychatmc).

> Hychat is currently in early alpha stage and in active development. It currently is non-functional and not recommended for use.

# Features

> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot/main/.github/assets/img/discord.png" alt="Hypixel Guild Chat Bot Discord Example">

- Bridges a Discord channel to Hypixel guild chat.
- Sends all guild related messages to the Discord channel (when I mean all, I mean **all**).
- Logs guild joins and leaves through a webhook (/g leave, /g join).
- Automatic restart and reconnections, making for zero down-time.
- Contains commands that can be used to control the bot's state, such as powering on and off, and sending chat messages through Discord (bot owner only).
- Slowmode and "say" commands (send messages as the Discord bot) for trusted users.
- Log slowmode and "say" command usage through an additional logging webhook.

# How Does It Work?

The bot is a self-hosted application that runs both a Discord bot and a Minecraft bot, which interconnect with each other. This is done using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/), two awesome Node.js libraries.

# Who's it for?

This application is for people who are into self-hosting their own applications on server infrastructures or on their own PC. If you don't know how to, don't worry! In the [new version](https://github.com/hychat-mc/hychat), you will be able to host your own fully-featured guild chat bot in just a couple of clicks! Updates will be provided on the [Hychat Twitter](https://twitter.com/hychatmc).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- A full access premium Minecraft account that you can use to connect to Hypixel.

## Initial Setup

1. Fork and star this repo.
2. Clone the repo into your own directory.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot.git
```
3. Enter the new directory and install the NPM packages.
```bash
$ cd hypixel-guild-chat-bot
$ npm install
```
4. Make a new Discord bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and get the bot token.
5. Grant the **Message Intent** for the bot.
6. Re-name the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit the values as instructed.
7. Edit the `config.js` file to your liking. Ensure you have valid IDs and such otherwise the bot will not work.
8. Test the bot.
```bash
$ node .
```

**If the bot logs into Hypixel, and you can send and receive messages through Discord, proceed to the next steps!** If you are having trouble getting it working, [open an issue](https://github.com/xMdb/hypixel-guild-chat-bot/issues) or [contact me through Discord](https://discord.com/users/253699775377965056).
